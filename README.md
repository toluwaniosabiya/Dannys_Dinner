# Dannys_Dinner
This project is adapted from Danny Ma's #8WeekSQLChallenge.

Three datasets are provided to solve some business problems associated with the loyalty program of a restaurant.
A detailed project brief can be found here: https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/

The .sql file contains queries to create the schema and tables, as well as the queries for the tasks.

The .ipynb file is an alternative way of creating the tables without a proper DBMS. It contains instructions on how to run it.

The .html file contains the sql queries and the explanations.

The .pdf file contains the expected query results.
